# food-household-items
This Google Spreadsheet helps to collect data about food and household items which you use regularly or time by time.

First sheet 'List' contains list of food and household items with 'Best before' date.
Second sheet 'Next 7 days' shows food and household items having 'Best before' date during next 7 days.
It means you should use them as soon as possible.

Google Apps Script checks sheet 'Next 7 days' and sends notification to your e-mail.
